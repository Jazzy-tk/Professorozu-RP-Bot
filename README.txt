Welcome to the professorozu bot. 

It's a simple bot for now, with an idea in mind to just learn about discord.py, and maybe make something out of it in the future

The bot does NOT include basic admin commands. I see that as a useless feature considering every other bot mos tlikely has it.

My goals for now are:

- learn more py by making the bot

- Make something new or something rather unusual

- Maybe add wiki capabilities to specific games

- Roleplay functions. Flexible roleplay fuction (A good example of those is the "good morning" command. 
It doesn't look for a specific message, but instead for words that might appear in a message like that, after what makes a response)

- Other feature unknown yet

If one wants to contribute, edit or give tips for existing/future commands, I'm open for chit chat!

For now, nothing interesting in here. *For now*
